# Trashmap

Do you know how much waste is produced in your country? Do you know what happens with your waste after you take it out? We created this interactive map to visualise the big picture, understand the global scale of the problem and identify best practices that could be adopted in other countries.

While the problem in low income countries is that there is not enough funding to collect the waste and dispose of it safely; high income countries have to deal with ever growing volumes of waste as the amount produced is directly proportional to the income level of the locals. The good news is that waste collection and initial sorting/processing is done locally; often things are done differently in neighbouring municipalities.Â Waste treatment is directly funded by your taxes, and these practices have a direct impact on your health and your local natural environment. Hence, you have the right to know what happens to your waste and suggest improvements.

Let's start by understanding the challenge we are all facing and look for local solutions that work! Let's do it for our planet and for the health of our loved ones.
